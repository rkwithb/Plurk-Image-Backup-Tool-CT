core/i18n.py

Lightweight i18n module for plurk-image-dl-ct.
- Call load_config() at app launch to read the persisted language from config.json.
- Call load_language() with the resolved language code to load translations.
- All modules use t(key, **kwargs) to get translated strings.
- Falls back to the key itself if a translation is missing (visible but non-crashing).
- Locale files are flat JSON stored in <program_folder>/locales/.
- Config is stored as config.json in the program folder: {"language": "zh_TW"}
- Supported languages: zh_TW, en
