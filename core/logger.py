core/logger.py

Centralized singleton logger for plurk-image-dl-ct.
- Call setup_logger() once at app launch (GUI or CLI).
- All other modules use get_logger() to obtain the shared logger instance.
- Call shutdown_logger() before exiting to flush and close the file cleanly.
- Log files are written to <program_folder>/log/session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
- Works in both script mode and PyInstaller frozen .exe mode.

Buffering strategy:
  The file is opened in line-buffered mode (buffering=1).
  This means every log line is flushed to disk immediately after being written,
  rather than accumulating in an 8KB memory buffer first.
  Trade-off: slightly more disk write operations, but each line is guaranteed
  on disk before the next one is written — critical for crash/kill scenarios
  where a full-buffer flush would never happen.
  Performance impact is negligible since the bottleneck is network I/O, not disk.

Log retention:
  setup_logger() keeps the most recent MAX_SESSION_LOGS session files.
  Older files are deleted at launch before the new session file is created.
  A retention summary is always written to the new session log.
  The cleanup message is returned to the caller for display in the UI or CLI.
